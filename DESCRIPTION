Description: This package allows the user to estimate treatment effects in 
    panel environments. The package currently implements a shared factor 
	modelling approach which allows for estimation of regression type 
	equations under full posterior inference. Upcoming is a switching 
	regression modelling approach. These models are helpful to deal with 
	correlation between preset factors of the subjects as well as correlation 
	structures in panel outcome.
